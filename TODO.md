# Flutter UI Redesign Plan

## Information Gathered
- **Current State**: Income & Expense Tracker with clean architecture (Bloc, Repository, SQLite), but outdated UI with basic dark theme, potential crashes/breaking issues.
- **Structure**: Shell page with animated notch bottom bar (Transactions, Analysis, Add tabs), routes for forms, balance cards, transaction lists, charts.
- **Tech Stack**: Flutter, Material 3, ScreenUtil, Bloc, Fl_Chart, Phosphor icons.
- **Issues**: Basic colors (teal primary, green/red semantic), poor spacing, outdated forms, basic charts, potential responsiveness issues.

## Plan
### 1. Visual Redesign (High Priority)
- **Color Scheme**: Modern dark theme with sophisticated palette (deep blues, purples, accents), gradients, better contrast.
- **Typography**: Improved font weights, sizes, better hierarchy using AppTypography.
- **Spacing & Layout**: Consistent padding, margins, better card designs with shadows/elevation.
- **Icons & Assets**: Enhanced iconography, better use of Phosphor icons.

### 2. UX Improvements (High Priority)
- **Navigation**: Smooth transitions, better bottom bar styling, improved shell page.
- **Forms**: Modern input designs, better validation feedback, improved date pickers.
- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced charts with animations, better legends, responsive design.
- **Cards & Lists**: Professional card designs, better transaction cards, improved balance display.

### 3. Responsiveness (Medium Priority)
- **Screen Sizes**: Ensure proper scaling with ScreenUtil, test on different devices.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Flexible layouts for tablets/phones, better use of available space.

### 4. Bug Fixes (Medium Priority)
- **Stability**: Fix potential crashes in forms, navigation, data loading.
- **Error Handling**: Better error states, loading indicators.
- **Performance**: Optimize list rendering, bloc state management.

### 5. New Features (Low Priority)
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, micro-interactions, loading animations.
- **Enhanced Charts**: Better chart types, interactive elements.
- **Accessibility**: Better contrast, screen reader support.
